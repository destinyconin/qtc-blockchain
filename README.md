# QTC Blockchain Project

## Overview
QTC is a learning blockchain project with these features:
- Total Supply: 1 Trillion QTC
- Block Reward: 10,000 QTC (no halving)
- Mining Algorithm: SHA-256
- Block Time: 10 minutes

## How to Run

### Method 1: Use compiled program
```bash
./qtc
```

### Method 2: Compile yourself
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./qtc
```

## Features Demo
The program will automatically demonstrate:
1. Create blockchain
2. Mine blocks for rewards
3. Create transactions
4. Confirm transactions
5. Check balances

## Technical Specs
- Algorithm: SHA-256
- Difficulty: Adjustable
- Transaction Privacy: Future implementation
- Public Balance: Yes

## Note
This is an educational project for learning blockchain principles, not a real cryptocurrency.
